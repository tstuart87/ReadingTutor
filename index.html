            <p>Marty was sad in the sea. As a clownfish, he felt
                like he should be funny. As a clownfish, he was
                not funny.
                He was not funny at all. He was very serious and
                did not make anyone laugh.
                He told jokes to the lionfish, but they did not
                laugh. He told jokes to the
                dogfish, but they did not
                laugh either.
                “I am a clownfish, and
                I should be funny,”
                Marty said aloud.

            <h3 id="three">Chapter Three - 3</h3>
            <p>Lily and her brother Ryan went camping with their
                mom and dad. Ryan and Dad set up the tent while
                Lily and Mom collected sticks to start a bonfire.
                Once the tent was set up, they started a fire in the
                bonfire pit. Lily and Ryan looked for long pointy sticks
                to use for cooking hot dogs over the fire while the fire
                was heating up. They found four perfect sticks, one
                for each of them.
                Lily and Ryan, and their
                mom and dad, each
                placed two hot dogs on
                their sticks. They held
                the hot dogs over the
                fire and turned the sticks
                slowly so every side of each hot dog was cooked.
                Then they put the hot dogs into buns and added
                ketchup and mustard. The hot dogs were delicious.

            <h3 id="four">Chapter Four - 4</h3>
            <p>Mary saw her mom spend money on groceries.
                She saw her dad spend money on new tools.
                That all seemed funny to Mary.
                Money is just green paper, Mary thought. Why
                do people give my parents groceries and tools
                for green paper?
                Mary took out her big box of crayons. She
                colored some paper green. She took her green
                paper to the toy store in town.
                “I want to buy a toy,” Mary declared.
                “Here is some green paper.”
                The lady at the store said, “Sorry. That's
                not real money. It is just green paper.”

            <h3 id="five">Chapter Five - 5</h3>
            <p>There was once a king of Scotland whose name was Robert Bruce. He
                needed to be both brave and wise because the times in which he lived
                were wild and rude. The King of England was at war with him and had led
                a great army into Scotland to drive him out of the land.
                Battle after battle had been fought. Six times Bruce had led his brave
                little army against his foes and six times his men had been beaten and
                driven into flight. At last his army was scattered, and he was forced to
                hide in the woods and in lonely places among the mountains.
                One rainy day, Bruce lay on the ground under a crude shed listening to
                the patter of the drops on the roof above him. He was
                tired and unhappy. He was ready to give up all hope. It
                seemed to him that there was no use for
                him to try to do anything more.
                As he lay thinking, he saw a spider over his
                head making ready to weave her web.
                He watched her as she toiled slowly
                and with great care. Six times she
                tried to throw her frail thread from
                one beam to another, and six times it
                fell short.
                “Poor thing,” said Bruce: “you, too, know
                what it is to fail.”
                But the spider did not lose hope with the sixth failure.
                With still more care, she made ready to try for the seventh time. Bruce
                almost forgot his own troubles as he watched her swing herself out upon
                the slender line. Would she fail again? No! The thread was carried safely
                to the beam and fastened there.

            <h3 id="six">Chapter Six - 6</h3>
            <p>“Mama,” said Susie Dean one
                summer’s morning, “may I go to
                the woods and pick
                berries?”
                “Yes,” replied Mrs. Dean,
                “but you must take Rover
                with you.” Susie brought
                her little basket, and her
                mother packed a nice lunch for her. She
                tied down the cover and fastened a tin cup
                to it. The little girl called Rover—a great Newfoundland dog—and gave
                him a tin pail to carry. “If I bring it home full, mama,” she said, “will you
                make some berry cakes?”
                Away she skipped, singing as she went down the lane and across the
                pasture. When she got to the woods, she put her lunch basket down
                beside a tree and began to pick berries. Rover ran about, chasing a
                squirrel and a rabbit, but never straying far from Susie.
                The tin pail was not a very small one. By the time it was two thirds full,
                Susie began to feel hungry and thought she would eat her lunch. Rover
                came and took his place at her side as soon as she began to eat. Did she
                give him some of the lunch? No, she was in a selfish mood and did no
                such thing.
                “There, Rover, run away! There’s a good dog,” she said, but Rover stayed
                near her, watching her steadil y with his clear brown eyes. The meat he
                wanted so much was soon eaten up, and all he got of the nice lunch was
                a small crust of gingerbread that Susie threw away.
